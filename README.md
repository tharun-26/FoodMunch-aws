Title: Deploying a Static Website with AWS CloudFront, Amazon S3, and Amazon EC2
In this project, we aim to deploy a static website using AWS services such as CloudFront for content delivery, Amazon S3 for storage, and Amazon EC2 for server-side processing if necessary. This project will showcase the steps involved in setting up these services and deploying a simple HTML/CSS website.
